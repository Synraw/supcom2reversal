# SupCom 2 Reversal Project
This project is the result of my attempts at reverse engineering the RTS game Supreme Commander 2.
As I am just doing this for fun, I have no real aim or goal with this project, and am just reversing whatever parts of the game I find interesting at the time.

### Current Focus:
 - Armies and Units
 - Rendering
 - Camera and projection matricies

### Tools Used:
 - IDA Pro for static analysis
 - ReClassEx (https://github.com/dude719/ReClassEx) for live structure analysis
 - CheatEngine & OllyDbg for debugging needs and live analysis
